Project Overview
This project is a RESTful web application that uses the Python framework Flask in conjunction with third party OAuth authentication. It showcases the basic importance of most applications: creating, updating, deleting, and reading. 

Beer Me
I decided to create an app similar to that of Untapp'd, but that you simply just add your own favorite beers/breweries. Follow the instructions below to run it locally!

Install Vagrant and VirtualBox
Clone the fullstack-nanodegree-vm
Launch the Vagrant VM (vagrant up)
Write your Flask application locally in the vagrant/catalog directory (which will automatically be synced to /vagrant/catalog within the VM).
Run your application within the VM (python /vagrant/catalog/application.py)
Access and test your application by visiting http://localhost:8000 locally

and that should do it!
